# Experiments to cover

- setting up n/w elements, n/w identification, TCP ping, ping sweep, ICMP ping, NULL scan, Fast Scan,UDP port scan, Sy Stealth, Fin Stealth, OS detection, diffrent protocols, HTTP,FTP, MQTP

- *Experiments* = how to determine N/w, different protocols like  TCP ping, ping sweep, ICMP ping, NULL scan, Fast Scan,UDP port scan, Sy Stealth, Fin Stealth, OS detection, diffrent protocols, HTTP,FTP, MQTP
How can we do this is ==>

- Server.py and Client.py 2 nodes required, server.py creates the TCP and UDP servers client will connect it we can use socket programming of python.
- After this we will show Experiments how these works in tkinter based python app

- we need servers for these experiments - TCP/UDP, HTTP, FTP, MQTP servers   created at server.py  user can select specific server from combobox and then can click on start server after use can stop server and then select differen server to start.

- For testing the Experiments client.py will connect specific server using algorithm and then can perform experiments by sending actual ping messages scanning operation and request response to learn these how it works Experiments.
